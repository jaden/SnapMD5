Why do I have to call repaint to get things to show up in CalcHashes?

Write up a CHM help file

Add a command line option to copy the MD5 or SHA1 to the clipboard and exit (/copymd5 or /copysha1)

If the MD5 string matches the clipboard, no need to compute the SHA-1

If two files are given on the command line, compare them?  How to change UI to represent that easily?
    Add result dialog that shows the two files and their hash results
    Instead of clipboard, have dropdown to compare it to another file
